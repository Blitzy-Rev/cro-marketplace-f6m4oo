# Technical Specifications

## 1. INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Molecular Data Management and CRO Integration Platform is a cloud-based application designed to revolutionize small molecule drug discovery workflows for small to mid-cap pharmaceutical companies. This platform addresses the critical gap between computational chemistry and experimental validation by providing a seamless interface for organizing molecular data, predicting properties, and connecting directly with Contract Research Organizations (CROs) for experimental testing.

The system solves three key business challenges:

1. Inefficient molecular data organization and analysis
2. Disconnected workflows between computational predictions and experimental validation
3. Cumbersome CRO engagement processes requiring multiple systems

Primary stakeholders include small to mid-cap pharmaceutical R&D teams, CRO service providers, and computational chemists. By streamlining these workflows, the platform is expected to reduce drug discovery cycle times by 30-40% and significantly lower operational costs associated with molecule management and CRO engagement.

### 1.2 SYSTEM OVERVIEW

## 5. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### 5.1 HIGH-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE

#### 5.1.1 System Overview

The Molecular Data Management and CRO Integration Platform employs a **microservices architecture** to provide flexibility, scalability, and maintainability. This architectural approach was selected to accommodate the diverse functional requirements spanning molecular data processing, AI integration, and CRO workflow management.

Key architectural principles include:

- **Domain-driven design** with bounded contexts for molecular management, AI prediction, and CRO integration
- **API-first approach** enabling clean separation between frontend and backend services
- **Event-driven communication** for asynchronous processing of long-running operations
- **Defense in depth** security model with multiple layers of protection
- **Infrastructure as code** for consistent environment provisioning

The system boundaries encompass the web application, backend services, databases, and integration points with external systems (AI prediction engine, CRO systems, document management). Major interfaces include RESTful APIs for synchronous operations and message queues for asynchronous processes.

#### 5.1.2 Core Components Table

| Component Name | Primary Responsibility | Key Dependencies | Critical Considerations |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Molecule Management Service | Handle molecule data ingestion, validation, and organization | PostgreSQL, S3, RDKit | SMILES validation performance, large dataset handling |
| AI Integration Service | Coordinate with external AI prediction engine | Message Queue, AI Engine API | Asynchronous processing, fault tolerance |
| CRO Submission Service | Manage experiment requests and CRO communication | Document Service, Notification Service | Secure data exchange, workflow state management |
| Document Exchange Service | Handle legal document management and e-signatures | S3, DocuSign API | Compliance with 21 CFR Part 11, audit trails |
| User Management Service | Handle authentication, authorization, and user profiles | OAuth Providers, RBAC System | Security, multi-tenant isolation |
| Frontend Application | Provide user interface for all system functions | Backend APIs, WebSockets | Responsive design, interactive visualizations |

#### 5.1.3 Data Flow Description

The primary data flow begins with CSV uploads containing molecular data (SMILES and properties). The Molecule Management Service validates this data using RDKit and stores it in PostgreSQL, with molecular structures indexed for efficient searching. Validated molecules are then sent to the AI Integration Service, which coordinates with the external AI engine to predict additional properties through asynchronous processing.

When users organize molecules into libraries and select candidates for testing, the CRO Submission Service creates experiment requests. These requests flow through the Document Exchange Service to handle legal requirements before being transmitted to CRO users. Communication between pharma and CRO users occurs through a secure messaging channel implemented with WebSockets for real-time updates.

Experimental results from CROs are processed by the Results Integration Service, which validates and transforms the data before storing it alongside the original molecular records. This creates a complete audit trail from computational prediction to experimental validation.

Key data stores include:

- PostgreSQL for relational data (molecules, properties, libraries, users)
- S3 for document storage and large CSV files
- Redis for caching frequently accessed data and session management
- Elasticsearch for advanced molecular searching capabilities

#### 5.1.4 External Integration Points

| System Name | Integration Type | Data Exchange Pattern | Protocol/Format | SLA Requirements |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AI Prediction Engine | Service API | Request-Response (Async) | REST/JSON | 95% of predictions \< 2 minutes |
| DocuSign | Third-party API | Request-Response | REST/JSON | 99.9% availability |
| CRO LIMS Systems (Optional) | Data Exchange | Batch Export/Import | REST/CSV | Daily synchronization |
| Enterprise SSO | Authentication | Federated Identity | SAML/OAuth 2.0 | 99.99% availability |
| AWS S3 | Storage Service | Direct Integration | S3 API | 99.99% durability |
| Monitoring Systems | Telemetry | Continuous Stream | OpenTelemetry | Real-time alerting |

| Overall Architecture | Monolith, Microservices, Serverless | Microservices | Better scalability for different components, team autonomy, technology flexibility |
| API Design | REST, GraphQL, gRPC | REST with some GraphQL | REST for standard operations, GraphQL for complex molecule queries |
| Frontend Architecture | MPA, SPA, SSR | SPA with React | Rich interactive experience needed for molecular visualization and organization |
| Deployment Model | VMs, Containers, Serverless | Containerized Microservices | Balance of control and scalability, consistent environments |

The microservices architecture was selected to allow independent scaling of the compute-intensive molecular processing components separately from the user-facing services. This approach also enables different teams to work on separate domains (molecular management, AI integration, CRO workflows) without tight coupling.

REST was chosen as the primary API style for its simplicity and broad support, with GraphQL added specifically for complex molecular queries where clients need flexible data retrieval patterns. This hybrid approach balances developer familiarity with the specific needs of scientific applications.

#### 5.3.2 Communication Pattern Choices

| Pattern | Use Case | Implementation | Justification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Synchronous REST | User-initiated actions, CRUD operations | FastAPI endpoints | Immediate feedback for user actions |
| Asynchronous Messaging | AI predictions, large CSV processing | AWS SQS, Celery | Long-running operations that shouldn't block user interface |
| WebSockets | Real-time notifications, CRO communication | FastAPI WebSockets | Interactive communication between pharma and CRO users |
| Batch Processing | Bulk molecule operations, nightly jobs | Celery scheduled tasks | Efficient processing of large datasets |

Asynchronous messaging was selected for AI predictions to handle the potentially long processing times without blocking the user interface. This pattern also provides natural retry capabilities and better fault tolerance for integration with external services.

WebSockets enable real-time communication between pharma and CRO users, creating a collaborative environment that reduces the traditional email back-and-forth that slows down experimental workflows.

#### 5.3.3 Data Storage Solution Rationale

| Data Type | Storage Solution | Key Features Used | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Molecular Data | PostgreSQL | Chemical extension, JSON support | Relational integrity with specialized chemical indexing |
| Document Storage | AWS S3 | Versioning, encryption, lifecycle policies | Scalable, secure storage with compliance features |
| Search Indexes | Elasticsearch | Chemical fingerprint indexing | Fast substructure and similarity searching |
| Caching Layer | Redis | In-memory storage, TTL, pub/sub | Performance optimization for frequent queries |

PostgreSQL was selected for molecular data due to its ability to handle both structured property data and chemical structures with specialized extensions. The relational model ensures data integrity across molecules, libraries, and experimental results.

S3 provides virtually unlimited storage for documents with built-in versioning and lifecycle policies that support compliance requirements. The combination with PostgreSQL for metadata creates a hybrid approach that optimizes for both document storage and queryability.

        O --> P[Retrieve IDs]
        P --> Q[Fetch Full Data]
        Q --> K
    end
```

#### 5.3.4 Caching Strategy Justification

| Cache Type | Implementation | Data Cached | Invalidation Strategy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| API Response Cache | Redis | Common molecule queries, library listings | TTL (5 minutes) + explicit invalidation on updates |
| Session Cache | Redis | User session data, authentication tokens | TTL based on session duration |
| Database Query Cache | PostgreSQL | Frequently accessed molecule properties | Automatic invalidation on data change |
| Static Asset Cache | CloudFront | UI components, molecular visualization assets | Version-based invalidation on deployment |

A multi-level caching strategy was implemented to optimize performance across different types of data access patterns. API response caching significantly improves the performance of molecule listing and filtering operations, which are frequently performed by users during molecule organization.

Session caching in Redis provides fast authentication checks without database queries on every request. The TTL-based invalidation ensures security while maintaining performance.

#### 5.3.5 Security Mechanism Selection

| Security Concern | Selected Mechanism | Implementation | Justification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Authentication | OAuth 2.0 + JWT | AWS Cognito | Industry standard, supports SSO integration |
| Authorization | RBAC with fine-grained permissions | Custom middleware | Complex permission requirements for molecule access |
| Data Encryption | AES-256 | AWS KMS, TLS 1.3 | Strong encryption for sensitive molecular IP |
| API Security | Rate limiting, input validation | API Gateway, Pydantic | Protection against abuse and injection attacks |
| Audit Logging | Structured logging, tamper-proof storage | CloudWatch Logs | 21 CFR Part 11 compliance requirement |

OAuth 2.0 was selected for authentication to support integration with enterprise identity providers while maintaining a consistent security model. The JWT implementation allows for stateless authentication with rich claims for authorization decisions.

RBAC with fine-grained permissions addresses the complex access control requirements where molecules may be shared across teams with different levels of access (view, edit, submit to CRO).

### 5.4 CROSS-CUTTING CONCERNS

#### 5.4.1 Monitoring and Observability Approach

The system implements a comprehensive monitoring strategy using the following components:

- **Metrics Collection**: Prometheus for system and application metrics
- **Logging**: Structured JSON logs with correlation IDs
- **Tracing**: OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing across services
- **Alerting**: PagerDuty integration for critical issues
- **Dashboards**: Grafana for visualization of system health

Key monitored metrics include:

- API response times (95th percentile \< 500ms)
- Molecule processing throughput (molecules/minute)
- AI prediction queue depth and processing time
- Error rates by service and endpoint
- Database query performance

Custom dashboards are provided for:

- Molecule processing pipeline health
- CRO submission workflow status
- System resource utilization
- Security and compliance metrics

#### 5.4.2 Logging and Tracing Strategy

| Log Type | Content | Storage | Retention |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Application Logs | Service operations, user actions | CloudWatch Logs | 90 days active, 7 years archived |
| Security Logs | Authentication, authorization decisions | CloudWatch Logs | 7 years (compliance requirement) |
| Audit Logs | Document access, molecule submissions | CloudWatch Logs + S3 archive | 7 years (compliance requirement) |
| Performance Logs | Slow queries, API latency | CloudWatch Logs | 30 days |

All logs include:

- Correlation ID for request tracing
- User ID (where applicable)
- Timestamp in ISO 8601 format
- Service name and version
- Structured data in JSON format

Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry provides end-to-end visibility across services, with particular focus on:

- CSV processing pipeline
- AI prediction workflow
- CRO submission process
- Document exchange operations

#### 5.4.3 Error Handling Patterns

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Error Detected] --> B{Error Type}
    
    B -->|Validation Error| C[Return 400 with details]
    B -->|Authentication Error| D[Return 401/403]
    B -->|Resource Error| E[Return 404]
    B -->|System Error| F[Log detailed error]
    
    F --> G[Generate error ID]
    G --> H[Return 500 with error ID]
    G --> I[Send alert if threshold exceeded]
    
    B -->|Integration Error| J{Retry Eligible?}
    J -->|Yes| K[Add to retry queue]
    J -->|No| L[Log permanent failure]
    
    K --> M[Apply exponential backoff]
    M --> N[Increment retry count]
    N --> O{Max retries?}
    O -->|No| P[Retry operation]
    O -->|Yes| Q[Move to dead letter queue]
    Q --> R[Trigger manual review]
    
    P --> S{Success?}
    S -->|Yes| T[Log recovery]
    S -->|No| N
```

The system implements a consistent error handling strategy across all components:

1. **Client-Facing Errors**:

   - Validation errors return 400 with specific field errors
   - Authentication/authorization errors return 401/403
   - Not found errors return 404 with consistent format

2. **System Errors**:

   - Logged with full context and stack trace
   - Assigned unique error ID returned to user
   - Alerts triggered based on frequency and severity

3. **Integration Errors**:

   - Retried with exponential backoff
   - Circuit breakers prevent cascade failures
   - Dead letter queues for manual investigation

4. **Recovery Procedures**:

   - Automated recovery for transient failures
   - Graceful degradation for non-critical services
   - Manual intervention workflows for critical failures

#### 5.4.4 Authentication and Authorization Framework

The authentication and authorization framework is built on AWS Cognito with custom authorization logic:

**Authentication Components**:

- OAuth 2.0 flows for web application
- JWT tokens with short expiration
- Refresh token rotation for security
- MFA for sensitive operations

**Authorization Model**:

- Role-based access control (RBAC) as foundation
- Resource-based permissions for molecules and libraries
- Attribute-based rules for special cases
- Permission inheritance through group membership

**Key Permission Sets**:

- Molecule Management (view, create, edit, delete)
- Library Organization (create, modify, share)
- CRO Submission (create, approve, view results)
- System Administration (user management, configuration)

**Implementation**:

- JWT claims contain roles and key attributes
- API Gateway validates token signature and expiration
- Service-level middleware enforces fine-grained permissions
- All authorization decisions are logged for audit

#### 5.4.5 Performance Requirements and SLAs

| Component | Metric | Target | Measurement Method |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| API Endpoints | Response Time | 95% \< 500ms | Application monitoring |
| CSV Processing | Throughput | 10,000 molecules/minute | Batch processing metrics |
| AI Prediction | Processing Time | 95% \< 2 minutes for 100 molecules | Queue monitoring |
| Search Functionality | Response Time | 95% \< 1 second | Application monitoring |
| Document Upload | Processing Time | 95% \< 5 seconds | Application monitoring |

**System-Wide SLAs**:

- 99.95% availability during business hours
- 99.9% availability after hours
- Maximum 1 hour recovery time for critical functions
- Maximum 4 hour recovery time for non-critical functions

**Scaling Triggers**:

- API servers scale when CPU \> 70% for 3 minutes
- Worker nodes scale when queue depth \> 1000 for 5 minutes
- Database read replicas added when read load \> 80% for 10 minutes

#### 5.4.6 Disaster Recovery Procedures

The disaster recovery strategy follows a warm standby approach with the following components:

**Backup Procedures**:

- Database: Daily full backups, hourly incremental backups
- Document Storage: Versioned with cross-region replication
- Configuration: Infrastructure as code in version control

**Recovery Time Objectives (RTO)**:

- Critical functions: 1 hour
- Non-critical functions: 4 hours
- Complete system: 8 hours

**Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)**:

- Database: 1 hour maximum data loss
- Document Storage: 15 minutes maximum data loss
- Transaction logs: 5 minutes maximum data loss

**Testing Schedule**:

- Quarterly recovery drills from backup
- Annual full disaster recovery simulation
- Automated recovery testing for critical components

**Failover Process**:

1. Detect failure through monitoring alerts
2. Initiate recovery workflow in secondary region
3. Restore data from latest backup
4. Verify system integrity and data consistency
5. Switch DNS to recovery environment
6. Notify users of temporary service interruption

| Submission | idx_submission_date | created_at | B-TREE | Time-based submission queries |
| ResultProperty | idx_result_property | (name, value) | B-TREE | Filter results by property values |

#### Partitioning Approach

For large-scale deployments, the following partitioning strategies will be implemented:

| Table | Partitioning Method | Key | Retention Strategy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Molecule | RANGE | created_at (monthly) | No automatic purging |
| MoleculeProperty | LIST | source (experimental/predicted) | No automatic purging |
| Submission | RANGE | created_at (quarterly) | Archive after 2 years |
| Result | RANGE | uploaded_at (quarterly) | Archive after 2 years |

### 6.2.2 DATA MANAGEMENT

#### Migration Procedures

The database migration strategy follows a controlled, versioned approach:

1. **Schema Migrations**

   - Implemented using Alembic with Python SQLAlchemy
   - Each migration is atomic and reversible
   - Migrations are applied in CI/CD pipeline with validation

2. **Data Migrations**

   - Batch processing for large data transformations
   - Temporary tables for complex transformations
   - Validation steps before and after migration

3. **Rollback Procedures**

   - Point-in-time recovery capability
   - Transaction log replay for fine-grained recovery
   - Schema version rollback scripts

#### Versioning Strategy

| Component | Versioning Approach | Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Schema | Sequential version numbers | Alembic revision IDs |
| Data Models | Semantic versioning | SQLAlchemy model versions |
| Queries | API versioning | Stored in version-specific modules |
| Migrations | Timestamped identifiers | YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format |

#### Archival Policies

| Data Type | Active Retention | Archive Trigger | Archive Storage | Retrieval Process |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Molecules | Indefinite | Never | N/A | N/A |
| Submissions | 2 years | Age \> 2 years | S3 Glacier | Restore request with 24h SLA |
| Results | 2 years | Age \> 2 years | S3 Glacier | Restore request with 24h SLA |
| Audit Logs | 90 days | Age \> 90 days | S3 Glacier | Restore request with 24h SLA |

#### Access Controls

Database access is strictly controlled through multiple layers:

1. **Authentication Layer**

   - IAM roles for service accounts
   - No direct user database access
   - Temporary credentials with automatic rotation

2. **Authorization Layer**

   - Row-level security policies
   - Column-level encryption for sensitive data
   - Role-based access control

3. **Network Security**

   - VPC isolation
   - Security groups limiting access
   - No public database endpoints

### 6.2.4 PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION

#### Query Optimization Patterns

| Query Type | Optimization Technique | Implementation | Expected Impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Molecule Filtering | Materialized views | Precomputed property ranges | 10x faster property filters |
| Library Contents | Denormalized counters | Maintain count in library table | Instant count operations |
| Submission Status | Status-specific indexes | Partial indexes by status | 5x faster status queries |
| Complex Joins | Query decomposition | Multiple simple queries | Reduced query complexity |

#### Caching Strategy

The system implements a multi-level caching strategy:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Client Request] --> B[API Gateway]
    B --> C[Application Server]
    
    C --> D{Cache Check}
    D -->|Miss| E[Database Query]
    D -->|Hit| F[Return Cached Result]
    
    E --> G[Result Processing]
    G --> H[Update Cache]
    H --> I[Return Result]

    end
    
    D -.-> J
    D -.-> K
    D -.-> L
    E -.-> M
```

| Cache Layer | Purpose | Implementation | Scope |

| User Interface Reads | Read Replica 1 | Eventually consistent | \< 50ms |
| Reporting Queries | Read Replica 2 | Eventually consistent | \< 500ms |
| Batch Processing | Read Replica 3 | Eventually consistent | \< 1000ms |

#### Batch Processing Approach

| Process | Implementation | Batch Size | Scheduling | Error Handling |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CSV Import | Chunked processing | 5,000 molecules | On-demand | Failed rows logged, continue |
| AI Predictions | Queue-based workers | 100 molecules | Continuous | Retry 3x with backoff |
| Library Updates | Bulk operations | 1,000 molecules | On-demand | Transaction rollback |
| Result Processing | Stream processing | 500 results | On upload | Partial success, log errors |

The database design provides a robust foundation for the Molecular Data Management and CRO Integration Platform, ensuring data integrity, performance, and compliance while supporting the complex relationships between molecules, libraries, and experimental submissions.

## 6.3 INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE

### 6.3.1 API DESIGN

The Molecular Data Management and CRO Integration Platform implements a comprehensive API architecture to facilitate seamless integration between components and external systems.

#### Protocol Specifications

| Protocol | Usage | Implementation | Justification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| REST | Primary API communication | HTTP/JSON | Industry standard, stateless, broad support |
| WebSockets | Real-time notifications | Socket.IO | Required for CRO-Pharma messaging |
| GraphQL | Complex molecule queries | Apollo Server | Flexible data retrieval for molecule properties |
| SFTP | Secure file transfers | AWS Transfer | Large dataset exchange with CROs |

The primary API communication follows RESTful principles with JSON payloads, while WebSockets enable real-time communication between pharma users and CROs. GraphQL is implemented for complex molecular property queries where flexible data retrieval is essential.

#### Authentication Methods

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant API Gateway
    participant Auth Service
    participant Cognito
    participant Resource Server
    
    Client->>API Gateway: Request with credentials
    API Gateway->>Auth Service: Forward authentication request
    Auth Service->>Cognito: Validate credentials
    Cognito-->>Auth Service: Return tokens
    Auth Service-->>API Gateway: Return JWT
    Client->>API Gateway: Request with JWT
    API Gateway->>API Gateway: Validate JWT
    API Gateway->>Resource Server: Forward authenticated request
```

| Authentication Method | Use Case | Implementation | Security Features |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OAuth 2.0 | User authentication | AWS Cognito | MFA, token rotation |
| API Keys | Service-to-service | API Gateway | Key rotation, usage plans |
| JWT | Session management | Custom middleware | Short expiration, signature validation |
| mTLS | High-security integrations | AWS Certificate Manager | Certificate validation |

OAuth 2.0 is the primary authentication method for user access, supporting integration with enterprise identity providers. Service-to-service communication uses API keys with strict rotation policies, while JWT tokens manage session state with short expiration times.

#### Authorization Framework

| Authorization Level | Implementation | Scope | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Role-Based | JWT claims | User type permissions | API Gateway authorizer |
| Resource-Based | Database policies | Molecule/library access | Service middleware |
| Attribute-Based | Dynamic rules | Contextual permissions | Custom authorization service |
| Scope-Based | OAuth scopes | API endpoint access | API Gateway authorizer |

The authorization framework implements multiple layers of access control:

- Role-based permissions define broad access patterns (Pharma User, CRO User, Admin)
- Resource-based policies control access to specific molecules and libraries
- Attribute-based rules handle dynamic permissions based on molecule status or submission state
- Scope-based controls limit API endpoint access based on OAuth scopes

#### Rate Limiting Strategy

| API Category | Rate Limit | Burst Allowance | Throttling Response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Standard Endpoints | 100 req/min | 20 req/burst | 429 Too Many Requests |
| Batch Operations | 20 req/min | 5 req/burst | 429 with retry-after |
| AI Prediction | 50 req/min | 10 req/burst | Queued processing |
| CRO Communication | 200 req/min | 50 req/burst | 429 with exponential backoff |

Rate limiting is implemented at the API Gateway level with different tiers based on operation type and resource consumption. Batch operations and AI predictions have lower limits due to their resource-intensive nature, while standard CRUD operations and communications have higher allowances.

#### Versioning Approach

| Versioning Method | Implementation | Lifecycle Policy | Deprecation Strategy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| URL Path | /api/v1/molecules | Major versions only | 6-month overlap period |
| Header-based | Accept: application/vnd.molecule.v2+json | Minor versions | 3-month notice period |
| Query Parameter | ?api-version=2023-09-01 | Date-based versions | Documentation of changes |

The API implements a multi-faceted versioning strategy:

- Major version changes use URL path versioning for clear separation
- Minor versions use header-based versioning for backward compatibility
- Date-based versions provide fine-grained control for specific endpoints

All API versions maintain backward compatibility within the same major version, and deprecation notices are provided at least 6 months before endpoint removal.

#### Documentation Standards

| Documentation Type | Tool | Update Frequency | Access Control |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OpenAPI Specification | Swagger UI | On deployment | Public |
| API Reference | ReDoc | On deployment | Public |
| Integration Guides | Markdown/GitBook | Monthly | Registered users |
| Code Examples | GitHub repositories | Quarterly | Public |

API documentation is automatically generated from code annotations using OpenAPI 3.0 specifications. The documentation includes:

- Endpoint descriptions and parameters
- Request/response schemas with examples
- Authentication requirements
- Error codes and handling
- Rate limiting information
- Code examples in multiple languages

### 6.3.2 MESSAGE PROCESSING

#### Event Processing Patterns

```mermaid

        M[Event] -.-> D
        N[Document] -.-> E
        O[Message] -.-> F
    end
```

| Event Pattern | Use Case | Implementation | Processing Model |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Command | Direct actions | SQS + Lambda | Synchronous with acknowledgment |
| Event | State changes | EventBridge | Asynchronous with fan-out |
| Document | Data updates | SNS + SQS | Guaranteed delivery |
| Message | User communications | WebSockets | Real-time with persistence |

The system implements multiple event processing patterns based on the specific requirements of each integration point:

- Command pattern for direct actions requiring immediate response
- Event pattern for state changes that trigger multiple downstream processes
- Document pattern for data updates requiring guaranteed delivery
- Message pattern for real-time communications between users

#### Message Queue Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "Producers"
        A[Molecule Service]
        B[AI Service]
        C[CRO Service]
    end
    
    subgraph "Message Brokers"
        D[SQS Standard Queues]
        E[SQS FIFO Queues]
        F[SNS Topics]
        G[EventBridge Bus]
    end
    
    subgraph "Consumers"
        H[Processing Workers]

    C --> F
    
    D --> H
    E --> H
    F --> I
    F --> J
    G --> I
    G --> K
```

| Queue Type | Use Case | Implementation | Delivery Guarantee |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Standard Queue | Batch processing | AWS SQS Standard | At-least-once |
| FIFO Queue | Ordered operations | AWS SQS FIFO | Exactly-once |
| Topic | Fan-out notifications | AWS SNS | Best-effort |
| Event Bus | Cross-service events | AWS EventBridge | At-least-once |

The message queue architecture uses different queue types based on the specific requirements of each integration scenario:

- Standard queues for high-throughput batch processing where order is not critical
- FIFO queues for operations requiring strict ordering (e.g., molecule status updates)
- Topics for fan-out notifications to multiple subscribers
- Event bus for cross-service event routing with pattern matching

#### Stream Processing Design

| Stream Type | Data Source | Processing Pattern | Consumers |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Molecule Updates | Database change data capture | Kinesis Data Streams | Analytics, Audit |
| User Activity | Application logs | Kinesis Firehose | Monitoring, Compliance |
| CRO Communications | WebSocket messages | Kinesis Data Analytics | Sentiment analysis |
| System Metrics | CloudWatch | Kinesis Data Analytics | Performance monitoring |

Stream processing is implemented for continuous data flows that require real-time analysis:

- Database change data capture streams molecule updates for analytics and audit
- Application logs stream user activity for monitoring and compliance
- WebSocket messages stream CRO communications for sentiment analysis
- System metrics stream performance data for monitoring and alerting

#### Batch Processing Flows

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Source as Data Source
    participant Trigger as Batch Trigger
    participant Processor as Batch Processor
    participant Queue as Job Queue
    participant Worker as Worker Nodes
    participant Target as Data Target
    
    Source->>Trigger: Data ready notification
    Trigger->>Processor: Initiate batch job
    Processor->>Processor: Split into tasks
    Processor->>Queue: Enqueue tasks
    
    loop For each task
        Queue->>Worker: Dequeue task
        Worker->>Worker: Process task
        Worker->>Target: Write results
        Worker->>Queue: Acknowledge completion
    end
    
    Processor->>Processor: Monitor completion
    Processor->>Trigger: Notify job completion
```

| Batch Process | Trigger | Processing Strategy | Error Handling |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CSV Import | File upload | Chunked processing | Failed rows logged, continue |
| AI Predictions | Queue threshold | Parallel processing | Retry with backoff |
| Result Integration | CRO upload | Sequential processing | Transaction rollback |
| Report Generation | Scheduled | Map-reduce | Partial results with warnings |

Batch processing flows are designed for efficient handling of large datasets:

- CSV imports use chunked processing to handle files with up to 500,000 molecules
- AI predictions use parallel processing with dynamic batching based on complexity
- Result integration uses sequential processing with transaction integrity
- Report generation uses map-reduce patterns for efficient aggregation

#### Error Handling Strategy

| Error Type | Detection Method | Recovery Approach | Notification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Transient Failures | Status codes, timeouts | Retry with exponential backoff | Log only |
| Validation Errors | Schema validation | Return detailed error messages | User notification |
| Integration Failures | Circuit breaker | Fallback to alternative service | Admin alert |
| Data Corruption | Checksum validation | Restore from backup | Critical alert |

The error handling strategy implements multiple layers of protection:

- Circuit breakers prevent cascading failures in service integrations
- Dead letter queues capture failed messages for analysis and replay
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff handle transient failures
- Comprehensive logging provides audit trail for troubleshooting
- Alerting thresholds trigger notifications based on error severity and frequency

## 6.4 SECURITY ARCHITECTURE

The Molecular Data Management and CRO Integration Platform requires robust security architecture due to the sensitive nature of pharmaceutical research data, intellectual property concerns, and regulatory compliance requirements. This section outlines the comprehensive security framework implemented across the platform.

### 6.4.1 AUTHENTICATION FRAMEWORK

#### Identity Management

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User Access Request] --> B{Identity Source}
    B -->|Corporate SSO| C[SAML Integration]
    B -->|Direct Login| D[Cognito User Pool]
    B -->|OAuth Provider| E[OAuth Integration]
    
    C --> F[Identity Verification]
    D --> F
    E --> F
    
    F --> G[JWT Token Generation]
    G --> H[Session Establishment]
    
    I[MFA Challenge] -.-> F
    J[Audit Logging] -.-> G
```

| Identity Provider | Implementation | Use Case | Security Features |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AWS Cognito | Primary user directory | Direct platform users | Password policies, MFA |
| Corporate SSO | SAML 2.0 integration | Enterprise pharma users | Federated authentication |
| OAuth 2.0 | Social/scientific identity | Researchers, external collaborators | Delegated authorization |

The platform implements a flexible identity management system that supports multiple authentication methods while maintaining a unified security model. User identities are centrally managed with comprehensive lifecycle controls including provisioning, de-provisioning, and periodic access reviews.

#### Multi-Factor Authentication

| MFA Method | User Type | Implementation | Trigger Conditions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Time-based OTP | All users | AWS Cognito Authenticator | Initial login, password reset |
| SMS Verification | Admin users | AWS SNS | Privileged operations, security settings |
| Email Verification | CRO users | Custom implementation | Document signing, result uploads |

Multi-factor authentication is enforced for all user types with varying levels of stringency based on the sensitivity of operations. The platform supports risk-based authentication that dynamically applies MFA challenges based on contextual factors such as:

- Login from new devices or locations
- Access to highly sensitive molecular data
- Submission of molecules to CROs
- Administrative operations

#### Session Management

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Client
    participant API
    participant TokenService
    participant ResourceServer
    
    User->>Client: Login
    Client->>API: Authentication Request
    API->>TokenService: Validate Credentials
    TokenService->>Client: Issue Access & Refresh Tokens
    
    Note over Client,ResourceServer: Active Session
    
    Client->>ResourceServer: Request with Access Token
    ResourceServer->>ResourceServer: Validate Token
    ResourceServer->>Client: Resource Response
    
    Note over Client,TokenService: Token Refresh
    
    Client->>TokenService: Refresh Token Request
    TokenService->>Client: New Access Token
    
    Note over Client,TokenService: Session Termination
    
    User->>Client: Logout
    Client->>TokenService: Revoke Tokens
    TokenService->>Client: Tokens Invalidated
```

| Session Parameter | Value | Justification | Security Control |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Access Token Lifetime | 15 minutes | Minimize unauthorized access window | Short-lived JWT tokens |
| Refresh Token Lifetime | 7 days | Balance security and user experience | Secure HTTP-only cookies |
| Idle Timeout | 30 minutes | Regulatory compliance | Automatic session termination |
| Concurrent Sessions | 3 maximum | Prevent credential sharing | Session registry with forced logout |

The session management system implements secure token handling with the following features:

- JWT tokens with digital signatures using RS256
- Token revocation capabilities for security incidents
- Secure storage in HTTP-only cookies with SameSite=Strict
- CSRF protection with double-submit cookie pattern

#### Password Policies

| Policy Element | Requirement | Enforcement | Exception Process |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Minimum Length | 12 characters | Registration and change forms | None permitted |
| Complexity | Upper, lower, number, symbol | Real-time validation | None permitted |
| History | No reuse of last 10 passwords | Password change validation | None permitted |
| Expiration | 90 days | Automated reminders | Temporary extension for admins |
| Lockout | 5 failed attempts | Progressive delays, then admin reset | Emergency access procedure |

Password policies are enforced through AWS Cognito with custom validation logic. The system also implements:

- Password strength meters with visual feedback
- Secure password reset workflows with time-limited tokens
- Breached password detection using HaveIBeenPwned API
- Secure credential storage using Argon2id hashing

### 6.4.2 AUTHORIZATION SYSTEM

#### Role-Based Access Control

```

| Role | Description | Base Permissions | Additional Controls |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| System Administrator | Platform-wide administration | All system functions | IP restriction, MFA |
| Pharma Administrator | Manage pharma organization | User, molecule, library management | Organization scope |
| Pharma Scientist | Conduct research activities | View, create molecules and libraries | Project scope |
| CRO Administrator | Manage CRO organization | User, result management | Organization scope |
| CRO Technician | Process experiments | View submissions, upload results | Assignment scope |
| Auditor | Review system activities | Read-only access to audit logs | Time-limited access |

The RBAC system is implemented with a principle of least privilege, ensuring users have only the permissions necessary for their job functions. Roles are assigned during user provisioning and can be modified by administrators with appropriate authority.

#### Permission Management

| Permission Category | Granularity | Inheritance | Conflict Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Molecule Data | Individual molecule, library | Organization → Project → User | Most restrictive wins |
| CRO Submissions | Submission, experiment | Organization → Department → User | Most restrictive wins |
| User Administration | Organization, department | Hierarchical | Explicit deny overrides |
| System Configuration | Feature, setting | None (explicit only) | Explicit assignment only |

Permissions are managed through a combination of:

- Role-based default permissions
- Resource-specific grants for exceptional cases
- Attribute-based rules for dynamic authorization
- Time-bound temporary permissions for special projects

The permission system supports delegation of authority with appropriate controls and audit trails.

#### Resource Authorization

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant API Gateway
    participant Auth Service
    participant Policy Engine
    participant Resource Service
    
    Client->>API Gateway: Request with JWT
    API Gateway->>Auth Service: Validate Token
    Auth Service->>API Gateway: Token Valid, User Context
    API Gateway->>Policy Engine: Authorization Request
    
    Policy Engine->>Policy Engine: Evaluate Policies
    Note over Policy Engine: Check Role Permissions
    Note over Policy Engine: Check Resource Ownership
    Note over Policy Engine: Apply Attribute Rules
    
    Policy Engine->>API Gateway: Authorization Decision
    
    alt Authorized
        API Gateway->>Resource Service: Forward Request
        Resource Service->>Resource Service: Apply Data Filters
        Resource Service->>Client: Return Authorized Data
    else Unauthorized
        API Gateway->>Client: 403 Forbidden
    end
```

Resource authorization is implemented at multiple levels:

1. **API Gateway** - Coarse-grained authorization based on JWT claims
2. **Service Layer** - Business logic authorization with policy enforcement
3. **Data Layer** - Row-level security in PostgreSQL for data isolation

The system implements attribute-based access control (ABAC) for complex authorization scenarios, particularly for molecule data where access may depend on:

- Molecule status (draft, submitted, experimental)
- Project association and sensitivity level
- Contractual relationships with CROs
- Intellectual property classification

#### Policy Enforcement Points

| Enforcement Point | Implementation | Responsibility | Failure Mode |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| API Gateway | Lambda Authorizer | Token validation, basic authorization | Reject with 401/403 |
| Service Middleware | Custom authorization service | Business rule enforcement | Reject with 403 |
| Database | Row-level security policies | Data isolation | Filter results |
| Frontend | UI permission directives | Interface element visibility | Hide/disable elements |

Policy enforcement follows a defense-in-depth approach with multiple validation layers. Each layer has independent enforcement logic to prevent authorization bypasses if one layer is compromised.

#### Audit Logging

| Event Category | Data Captured | Storage | Retention |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Authentication Events | User, timestamp, IP, success/failure | CloudWatch Logs | 2 years |
| Authorization Decisions | Resource, action, decision, policy | CloudWatch Logs | 2 years |
| Data Access | User, resource, operation, fields accessed | PostgreSQL audit tables | 7 years |
| Administrative Actions | User, action, parameters, before/after | CloudWatch Logs | 7 years |

The audit logging system provides comprehensive visibility into all security-relevant events with the following features:

- Tamper-evident log storage with cryptographic verification
- Structured log format for automated analysis
- Real-time alerting for suspicious activities
- Compliance-ready reports for regulatory requirements

    subgraph "Region A (Primary)"
        A1[Load Balancer] --> B1[ECS Cluster]
        B1 --> C1[Service 1]
        B1 --> D1[Service 2]
        B1 --> E1[Service 3]
        F1[(RDS Primary)] --> G1[(RDS Standby)]
        H1[ElastiCache]
        I1[S3 Bucket]
    end
    
    subgraph "Region B (DR)"
        A2[Load Balancer] --> B2[ECS Cluster]
        B2 --> C2[Service 1]
        B2 --> D2[Service 2]
        B2 --> E2[Service 3]
        F2[(RDS Replica)]
        H2[ElastiCache]
        I2[S3 Bucket]
    end
    
    I1 -.->|Replication| I2

### 8.3 CONTAINERIZATION

#### 8.3.1 Container Platform Selection

Docker has been selected as the containerization platform for the following reasons:

1. Industry standard with mature tooling
2. Excellent support for Python and Node.js applications
3. Strong security features and scanning tools
4. Compatibility with AWS ECS and other orchestration platforms
5. Extensive base image ecosystem

#### 8.3.2 Base Image Strategy

| Service | Base Image | Justification | Security Considerations |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Frontend | nginx:alpine | Minimal footprint, security | Regular security updates |
| Backend API | python:3.10-slim | Reduced size, official support | Minimal dependencies |
| Molecule Service | python:3.10-slim + RDKit | Required for molecular processing | Custom build with security scanning |
| Worker Services | python:3.10-slim | Optimized for background processing | Minimal attack surface |

**Base Image Security Practices:**

1. Use official images whenever possible
2. Pin specific versions (avoid `latest` tag)
3. Implement multi-stage builds to minimize image size
4. Remove development dependencies from production images
5. Regular security scanning and updates

#### 8.3.3 Image Versioning Approach

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Source Code] --> B[Build Process]
    B --> C[Image Tag Generation]
    C --> D{Tag Type}
    D -->|Development| E[branch-commit_hash]
    D -->|Release Candidate| F[rc-semver]
    D -->|Production| G[semver]
    E --> H[ECR Repository]
    F --> H
    G --> H
```

| Image Type | Tagging Strategy | Retention Policy | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Development | `dev-{branch}-{short_commit}` | 7 days | Development and testing |
| Release Candidate | `rc-{major}.{minor}.{patch}` | 30 days | Staging and UAT |
| Production | `{major}.{minor}.{patch}` | 1 year | Production deployment |
| Latest Stable | `latest` | N/A (alias) | Quick reference |

#### 8.3.4 Build Optimization Techniques

| Technique | Implementation | Benefit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Multi-stage Builds | Separate build and runtime stages | Smaller final images |
| Layer Caching | Optimize Dockerfile order | Faster builds |
| Dependency Caching | Use BuildKit cache mounts | Efficient dependency installation |
| Parallel Builds | Build images concurrently | Reduced pipeline time |

#### 8.3.5 Security Scanning Requirements

| Scan Type | Tool | Frequency | Integration Point |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Vulnerability Scanning | Trivy | Every build | CI/CD pipeline |
| Secret Detection | git-secrets | Pre-commit, CI/CD | Developer workflow, CI/CD |
| SCA (Dependencies) | OWASP Dependency Check | Daily | CI/CD pipeline |
| Compliance Scanning | Docker Bench | Weekly | Scheduled job |

All container images must pass security scanning before deployment to any environment. Critical vulnerabilities block deployment, while high-severity issues require documented exceptions.

### 8.4 ORCHESTRATION

#### 8.4.1 Orchestration Platform Selection

Amazon ECS with AWS Fargate has been selected as the orchestration platform for the following reasons:

1. Serverless operation reduces operational overhead
2. Tight integration with AWS services (ALB, IAM, CloudWatch)
3. Simplified scaling and deployment model
4. Strong security posture with task-level isolation
5. Cost-effective for variable workloads
