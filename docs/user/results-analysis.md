This comparison helps you understand how different experimental conditions or CROs affect your results.

### Comparing with Predicted Properties

You can compare experimental results with AI-predicted properties:

1. Navigate to a molecule's detail page
2. View the 'Properties' section, which shows both predicted and experimental values
3. Click on 'Compare Predictions vs. Experiments'
4. Select properties to include in the comparison
5. Analyze the correlation between predicted and experimental values

This comparison helps validate the accuracy of AI predictions and improve future prediction models.

## Integrating Results with Molecules

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions when working with experimental results:

### Missing or Incomplete Results

If results appear incomplete or missing:

1. Check the result status - it may still be processing
2. Verify that all molecules were included in the CRO submission
3. Contact the CRO if specific measurements are missing
4. Check for any error messages in the result notes
5. Consult the system administrator if data appears corrupted

### Visualization Issues

If visualizations don't display correctly:

1. Ensure the property contains numeric values suitable for visualization
2. Try refreshing the browser or clearing the cache
3. Check that you have selected appropriate visualization settings
4. Verify that the data range is appropriate (extreme outliers can affect scaling)
5. Try a different browser if the issue persists

### Integration Problems

If you encounter issues when applying results to molecules:

1. Verify that you have the necessary permissions
2. Check that the molecules still exist in the system
3. Ensure the result status is 'Completed'
4. Look for error messages in the application logs
5. Contact support if the issue persists

## Best Practices
