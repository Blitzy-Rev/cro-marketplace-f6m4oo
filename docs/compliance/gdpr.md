# GDPR Compliance Documentation
## Molecular Data Management and CRO Integration Platform

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines how the Molecular Data Management and CRO Integration Platform complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for the protection of personal data in pharmaceutical research and development.

### 1.2 Scope
This compliance documentation covers all aspects of the platform that process personal data, including user information, research data that may contain personal identifiers, and integration with third-party services. It addresses the requirements of the GDPR, including data protection principles, lawful bases for processing, data subject rights, and technical and organizational measures.

### 1.3 Regulatory Background
The General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation 2016/679) is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy in the European Union and the European Economic Area. The GDPR aims to give individuals control over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business by unifying the regulation within the EU.

Key GDPR principles include lawfulness, fairness and transparency, purpose limitation, data minimization, accuracy, storage limitation, integrity and confidentiality, and accountability. These principles form the foundation of the platform's data protection approach.

In the pharmaceutical research context, the GDPR provides both challenges and specific accommodations, particularly regarding scientific research data processing under Article 89.

### 1.4 Applicability to Platform
The Molecular Data Management and CRO Integration Platform may act in dual roles under GDPR:

1. **As a Data Processor**: When processing personal data on behalf of pharmaceutical companies (data controllers) who determine the purposes and means of processing.
2. **As a Data Controller**: When determining the purposes and means of processing specific data sets, particularly related to platform users and account management.

The platform's GDPR obligations apply whenever it processes personal data of EU data subjects, regardless of the platform's physical location.
