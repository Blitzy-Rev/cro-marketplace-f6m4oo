---

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the disaster recovery (DR) procedures, backup strategies, and business continuity plans for the Molecular Data Management and CRO Integration Platform. It provides comprehensive guidance for maintaining system availability and data integrity during various failure scenarios.

The disaster recovery strategy is designed to meet the following objectives:

- Protect critical molecular data and research assets
- Ensure business continuity during infrastructure or application failures
- Meet regulatory compliance requirements for data protection and recovery
- Provide clear procedures for different disaster scenarios
- Define roles and responsibilities during recovery operations

This document should be used in conjunction with the monitoring procedures and CI/CD pipeline documentation to ensure a comprehensive approach to system resilience and recovery.

## 2. Disaster Recovery Strategy Overview

The Molecular Data Management and CRO Integration Platform implements a comprehensive disaster recovery strategy based on the following principles:

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of redundancy and protection
2. **Geographic Distribution**: Multi-region deployment for resilience against regional failures
3. **Automated Recovery**: Automated procedures for common failure scenarios
4. **Regular Testing**: Scheduled DR drills to validate procedures
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Regular review and enhancement of DR capabilities

### Recovery Objectives

| Metric | Target | Measurement | Validation Method |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Recovery Time Objective (RTO) | Critical functions: 1 hour<br>Non-critical functions: 4 hours<br>Complete system: 8 hours | Time to restore functionality | DR drills, actual recovery events |
| Recovery Point Objective (RPO) | Database: 1 hour maximum data loss<br>Document Storage: 15 minutes maximum data loss<br>Transaction logs: 5 minutes maximum data loss | Data currency at recovery point | Backup validation, recovery testing |
| Service Level Objective (SLO) | 99.95% availability for critical functions | Uptime monitoring | Monitoring system |

### Disaster Recovery Tiers

The platform implements a tiered approach to disaster recovery based on the criticality of components:

| Tier | Components | Recovery Strategy | RTO | RPO |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tier 1 (Critical) | Database, Authentication, API Gateway | Multi-AZ with automated failover, Cross-region replication | < 1 hour | < 5 minutes |

    end
```

## 3. High Availability Architecture

The platform is designed with high availability as a core principle, using the following AWS architectural patterns:

### Multi-AZ Deployment

All critical components are deployed across multiple Availability Zones to ensure resilience against AZ failures:

- Application load balancers span multiple AZs
- ECS services distributed across multiple AZs
- RDS databases deployed in Multi-AZ configuration
- ElastiCache clusters with nodes in different AZs
- Auto-scaling groups configured to maintain balance across AZs

### Database Redundancy

Database high availability is achieved through multiple layers of redundancy:

- RDS instances in Multi-AZ configuration with synchronous replication
- Read replicas for scalability and reduced load on primary instances
- Point-in-time recovery through continuous backup
- Cross-region read replicas for disaster recovery
- Automated failover with minimal downtime

### Stateless Application Tier

The application tier is designed to be stateless for maximum resilience:

- No local state maintained on application servers
- Session state stored in distributed Redis cache
- Application containers are fully replaceable
- Auto-scaling based on load metrics
- Health checks to detect and replace unhealthy instances

### Cross-Region Replication

Critical data is replicated across AWS regions to protect against regional outages:

- Database cross-region replication (asynchronous)
- S3 bucket cross-region replication for all critical buckets
- Container images replicated to secondary region repositories
- Configuration and secrets available in both regions
- DNS configuration prepared for region failover

### Automated Failover Mechanisms

The platform includes automated failover mechanisms to minimize recovery time:

- Route 53 health checks for DNS failover
- RDS Multi-AZ automated failover
- Application load balancer health checks
- Container health checks with automatic replacement
- Circuit breakers for service dependencies

```mermaid

        B1 --> C1[Service 1]
        B1 --> D1[Service 2]
        B1 --> E1[Service 3]
        F1[(RDS Primary)] --> G1[(RDS Standby)]
        H1[ElastiCache]
        I1[S3 Buckets]
    end
    
    subgraph "Region B (DR)"
        A2[Load Balancer] --> B2[ECS Cluster]
        B2 --> C2[Service 1]
        B2 --> D2[Service 2]
        B2 --> E2[Service 3]
        F2[(RDS Read Replica)]
        H2[ElastiCache]
        I2[S3 Replication Buckets]
    end
    
    I1 -.->|Replication| I2
    F1 -.->|Replication| F2
    J[Route 53] --> A1
    J -.->|Failover| A2
```

```

The DR network is configured to mirror the production network, with the following considerations:

- Identical subnet structure and CIDR ranges
- Pre-configured security groups and NACLs
- VPC peering or Transit Gateway for cross-region communication
- DNS failover configuration in Route 53
- Network ACLs aligned with production

### DR Scaling Strategy

The DR infrastructure uses a warm standby approach with minimal resources during normal operations, with the ability to scale up during recovery:

- Minimal ECS tasks running in secondary region
- Auto-scaling groups configured but scaled down
- Database read replicas maintained for data currency
- Ability to rapidly scale up using infrastructure automation
- Regular testing of scaling capabilities

## 10. Data Recovery Procedures

This section provides detailed procedures for recovering different types of data in the event of data loss or corruption.

### Database Data Recovery

**Point-in-Time Recovery Procedure:**

1. **Identify Recovery Point:**
   - Determine the timestamp before data corruption or loss
   - Verify transaction log availability for selected point

2. **Initiate Recovery:**
   ```bash
   # Using AWS CLI
   aws rds restore-db-instance-to-point-in-time \
     --source-db-instance-identifier moleculeflow-prod \
     --target-db-instance-identifier moleculeflow-recovery \
     --restore-time "2023-09-15T08:45:00Z" \
     --db-instance-class db.r5.2xlarge \
     --multi-az \
     --storage-type gp3 \
     --allocated-storage 100
   ```

3. **Monitor Recovery Progress:**
   ```bash
   aws rds describe-db-instances \
     --db-instance-identifier moleculeflow-recovery \
     --query 'DBInstances[0].DBInstanceStatus'
   ```

4. **Verify Recovered Data:**
   - Connect to recovered instance
   - Run data integrity checks
   - Verify critical tables and records
   - Validate application functionality with recovered database

5. **Switch to Recovered Database:**
   - Update application configuration to use recovered database
   - Verify application connectivity
   - Monitor application performance and error rates

### S3 Object Recovery

**Object Version Recovery Procedure:**

1. **Identify Objects to Recover:**
   - Determine affected objects and required versions
   - Verify version availability in bucket versioning

2. **List Available Versions:**
   ```bash
   # Using AWS CLI
   aws s3api list-object-versions \
     --bucket moleculeflow-documents \
     --prefix "path/to/object" \
     --query 'Versions[*].{Key:Key,VersionId:VersionId,LastModified:LastModified}'
   ```

3. **Restore Previous Version:**
   ```bash
   # Using AWS CLI
   aws s3api copy-object \
     --bucket moleculeflow-documents \
     --copy-source moleculeflow-documents/path/to/object?versionId=VERSION_ID \
     --key path/to/object
   ```

4. **Verify Restored Objects:**
   - Download and verify object integrity
   - Check metadata and permissions
   - Validate application access to restored objects

### Deleted Object Recovery

**Deleted Object Recovery Procedure:**

1. **Identify Deleted Objects:**
   - Determine which objects were deleted
   - Verify deletion markers in versioned buckets

2. **List Deletion Markers:**
   ```bash
   # Using AWS CLI
   aws s3api list-object-versions \
     --bucket moleculeflow-documents \
     --prefix "path/to/object" \
     --query 'DeleteMarkers[*].{Key:Key,VersionId:VersionId,LastModified:LastModified}'
   ```

3. **Restore Deleted Object:**
   ```bash
   # Using AWS CLI
   aws s3api copy-object \
     --bucket moleculeflow-documents \
     --copy-source moleculeflow-documents/path/to/object?versionId=LAST_VERSION_ID \
     --key path/to/object
