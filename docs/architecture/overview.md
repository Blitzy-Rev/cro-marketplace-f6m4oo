## 1. Introduction

The Molecular Data Management and CRO Integration Platform is a cloud-based application designed to revolutionize small molecule drug discovery workflows for small to mid-cap pharmaceutical companies. This document provides a comprehensive overview of the system architecture, detailing the design decisions, component interactions, and implementation approaches that enable the platform's core capabilities.

The platform addresses three key business challenges:

1. Inefficient molecular data organization and analysis
2. Disconnected workflows between computational predictions and experimental validation
3. Cumbersome CRO engagement processes requiring multiple systems

This architecture overview serves as an entry point to more detailed documentation on specific aspects of the system, including backend services, frontend components, data model, and security architecture.

## 2. System Context

The platform operates within a broader ecosystem of users, services, and external systems. Understanding this context is essential for comprehending the system boundaries and integration points.
